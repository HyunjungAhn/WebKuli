!2 !-SequenceFixture-!
'''!- SequenceFixture -!'''!- is very similar to -!'''!- DoFixture -!'''!- and has almost the same features &mdash; in fact the only difference between those two is the naming convention for methods. Instead of using odd cells to construct a method name, -!'''!- SequenceFixture -!'''!- takes the first cell in each row as the method name, and all other cells as arguments (if there are no keywords to modify the row functionality). All -!'''!- DoFixture -!'''!- keywords are supported in -!'''!- SequenceFixture -!'''!- too, as well as the flow mode (see -![[!-Flow Mode-!][<UserGuide.FixtureGallery.ImportantConcepts.FlowMode]]!- ) and domain object wrapping (see -![[!-System under test-!][<UserGuide.FixtureGallery.ImportantConcepts.SystemUnderTest]]!-). -!

# section Table Format
!3 !-Table Format-!
!-The table format is the same as for -!'''!- DoFixture -!'''!- (see -![[!-DoFixture-!][<UserGuide.FixtureGallery.FitLibraryFixtures.DoFixture]]!-), with the difference in method naming. -!
