!*****> Parallel: Run Tasks In Parallel

The parallel element represents a container of task elements which will be executed in parallel. Each task element it contains will be executed on a separate STAX-Thread and existing variables are cloned for each thread. The parallel element is considered to be complete when each of its contained task elements has completed. A parallel element may contain any number of task elements. You may nest parallel elements.
